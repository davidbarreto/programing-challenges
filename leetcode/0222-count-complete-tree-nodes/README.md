# Count Complete Tree Nodes (Difficulty: Easy)

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

---

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than&nbsp;O(n)&nbsp;time complexity.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
	0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 5 * 104
	The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
