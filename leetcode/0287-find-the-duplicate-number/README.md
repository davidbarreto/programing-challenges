# Find the Duplicate Number (Difficulty: Medium)

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

---

Given an array of integers nums containing&nbsp;n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this&nbsp;repeated&nbsp;number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums&nbsp;and using only constant extra space.

&nbsp;
Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3```

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= n &lt;= 105
	nums.length == n + 1
	1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= n
	All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

Follow up:


	How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
	Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
