# Basic Calculator (Difficulty: Hard)

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)

---

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

&nbsp;
Example 1:

```
Input: s = &quot;1 + 1&quot;
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = &quot; 2-1 + 2 &quot;
Output: 3
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = &quot;(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)&quot;
Output: 23
```

&nbsp;
Constraints:


	1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 105
	s consists of digits, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;(&#39;, &#39;)&#39;, and &#39; &#39;.
	s represents a valid expression.
	&#39;+&#39; is not used as a unary operation (i.e., &quot;+1&quot; and &quot;+(2 + 3)&quot; is invalid).
	&#39;-&#39; could be used as a unary operation (i.e., &quot;-1&quot; and &quot;-(2 + 3)&quot; is valid).
	There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
	Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
